			<p class="nonothead"><b>Overview</b></p>
			<p class="nonot">If you are reading this; chances are, you are newly accepted into Ignis Fatuus. Congratulations. This page is the hub for almost all information that is needed in Ignis Fatuus.</p>
			<br/>
			<p class="nonothead"><b>Duties</b></p>
			<p class="nonot">To put it simply, Ignis is an Special Operations Squad and at the same time acts as a "Death Squad" for the Administrator. We consists of only the best of the best which makes us the pinnacle and the elite of the Foundation. Below are the things that an Ignis may only act in.</p>
			<p class ="nonot"><b>Hostage Rescue:</b> When you've got reports about an hostage being held, you will first route the message to the Umbra, and they will tell you what to do. All Ignis currently present in the game will get on an helicopter and paratroop to rescue the hostage.</p>
			<p class ="nonot"><b>Raids:</b> This is where it gets difficult to not reveal yourself to others. There will be a secret exit from your spawn to outside. You will use this path to avoid contact with others. You know what happens next; pew pew and kill the hostiles. If they by any chance enter Sector 2 or 1, let the MTF deal with it. You would only show up if they managed to enter Sector 4 or 5.</p>
			<p class ="nonot"><b>Administrator's Order:</b> Pretty self explanatory. When given an order by the Administrator, you will do it, period.</p>
			<p class ="nonot"><b>Patrolling:</b> You are only allowed to patrol in Sector 4 and 5. You are NOT under any circumstances allowed to leave (unless overlapped with other duties). If anyone comes in Sector 4 or 5, you are to hide immediately so that you cannot be seen.</p>
			<p class ="nonot"><b>Recointainment:</b> You are to only recontain the SCPs that is located inside Sector 4 and 5. Lockdown the entrance if needed to recontain without being seen.</p>
			<br/>
		
			<p class="nonothead"><b>Composure, Obedience, Accord</b></p>
			<p class="nonot">There is a certain way that all Ignis are expected to act, and an Ignis should adopt this mentality as well if they wish to progress within the unit. This mentality is best summarized as:</p>
			<p class="nonot"><b>Composure:</b> knowing the right time and place for when and how to act.</p>
			<p class="nonot"><b>Obedience:</b> following a valid order from a superior without hesitation.</p>
			<p class="nonot"><b>Accord:</b> the importance of respecting your comrades and getting along.</p>		
			<br/>
			<p class="nonothead"><b>On-duty specifications</b></p>
			<p class="nonot"><b>1:</b> When present on duty, you are expected to follow ALL the rules and regulations at ALL times. There are no exceptions.</p>
			
			<br/>
			<p class="nonothead"><b>The Written Laws of Ignis Fatuus</b></p>
			<p class="nonot"><b>1:</b> You may NOT be seen by anybody when you are online on the site (unless under supervision of the Umbra or the Administrator). If you were seen, leave the game and report in #reports.</p>
			<p class="nonot"><b>2:</b> Do not add fuel to the fire. People are meant to not know that Ignis exists; this is why Law 1 is written. If; by any chance that someone is talking about Ignis in the main discord or anywhere, do not join in the conversation. Ignore them. DO NOT let them taunt you in any way making you open up your mouth and start blurting out stuff about us. If you were addressed or asked about Ignis, ignore them. Long story short; you're not an Ignis, you know nothing. Nothing happened.</p>
			<p class="nonot"><b>3:</b> An Ignis must <b>ALWAYS</b> be professional, this cannot be stressed enough. Though there are many ways to define maturity, we look at immaturity as whether an Ignis is behaving in an appropriate manner depending on the situation. This means messing around in places like a raid or defense will not be tolerated, and a strict, serious attitude is required at all times.</p>
			<p class="nonot"><b>4:</b> You will be the one to decide whether you may speak or not depending on the situation. However; when speaking publicly and when excluded from Law 1, Ignis are expected to present themselves well in all aspects, including that of speaking. Full grammar and punctuation is expected to be used when on duty. Full stops, capital letters, commas, etc, fall into this category. You are also required to spell to the best of your ability, so that there are less miss-communications. If you are on-site, you must use the dialog chat.</p>
			<p class="nonot"><b>5:</b> Respect. Not just those above, but those below you. Respect is something that brings us all together as a community and as an Foundation. We are all united, so we should all treat each other as if our lives depended on it. You should not go around starting arguments and making grudges between your fellow soldiers, for they will be the person you fight with when in action.</p>
			<p class="nonot"><b>6:</b> Ignis are NEVER to use all-caps. The only exception to this rule is Officers who are trying to make their orders clear, and unmissable.</p>
			<p class="nonot"><b>7:</b> Ignis are required to speak in teamchat at Raids, even if bubble-chat is the only form of communication available. Ignis must appear completely silent to the enemy whilst an offence or defence is taking place.</p>
			<p class="nonot"><b>8:</b> Negativity, sarcasm, and toxicity are not tolerated on or off-duty. This is not to be confused with simply disagreeing with someone or pointing out a flaw in an idea, but these criticisms must remain constructive.</p>
			<p class="nonot"><b>9:</b> All laws is subject to change at any time without notice.</p>
			<br/>
			<p class="nonothead"><b>Guarding the Administrator</b></p>
			<p class="nonot">The life of the Administrator is of the utmost importance. The Administrator must NEVER die when an Ignis is present. With that said, an Ignis must act and think swiftly and quickly with their surroundings at all times.</p>
			<p class="nonot">You are to have your weapon up and be ready at ALL times. Anyone that is seen as a threat, disregard rank; whether it be an O5 or a Site Director, must be terminated immediately (unless stated otherwise by the Administrator himself). If the Administrator's life is endangered by an SCP, you must quickly detain the Administrator to a safe spot (unless stated otherwise - incase for development, testing and out-of-rp purposes).</p>
			<p class="nonot">You are to take your own initiative on what to do, and do whatever you could to protect the Administrator's life.</p>
