			<p class="nonothead"><b>Overview</b></p>
			<p class="nonot">If you are reading this; chances are, you are newly accepted into Ignis Fatuus. Congratulations. This page is the hub for almost all information that is needed in Ignis Fatuus.</p>
			<br/>
			<p class="nonothead"><b>Duties</b></p>
			<p class="nonot">To summarize it; Ignis Fatuus plays a major role as the vanguard of the Foundation. You are the game-changer. At the same time, Ignis Fatuus acts as a police force within the Foundation for <b>non-trivial</b> matters. When needed, Ignis Fatuus also acts as a bodyguard unit for the Administrator.</p>
			<br/>
			<p class="nonothead"><b>Record, Report, Remind</b></p>
			<p class="nonot">As an Ignis Fatuus. It is your duty to maintain law and order within the Foundation. The Record, Report, Remind (RRR) begins when one sees another personnel breaking the rule and/or the Code of Ethics <b>that are not trivial.</b> It is your duty to follow through with this system if you see anything happening. The RRR system is broken down as:</p>
			<p class="nonot">Record: If a person in question has broken any rule, you must take it upon yourself to begin collecting evidences. Evidence is not exclusively limited to video, the four options for recording incidents are: video recordings, screenshots, audio, or three witnesses.</p>
			<p class="nonot">Report: After the evidence is collected, the next stage is to report the lawbreaker with evidence to the appropriate person who can handle the situation within Ignis. This is dependent on the lawbreakers rank within the Foundation. Further actions will depend on the matter.</p>
			<p class="nonot">Remind: After the report has been made, this is where things start. Ignis Fatuus will approach the person in question and "remind" them about the matter. The person in question will be punished/interrogated depending on the matter. Further actions will be improvised.</p>
			<br/>
			<p class="nonothead"><b>Composure, Obedience, Accord</b></p>
			<p class="nonot">There is a certain way that all Ignis are expected to act, and an Ignis should adopt this mentality as well if they wish to progress within the unit. This mentality is best summarized as:</p>
			<p class="nonot"><b>Composure:>/b> knowing the right time and place for when and how to act.</p>
			<p class="nonot"><b>Obedience:</b> following a valid order from a superior without hesitation.</p>
			<p class="nonot"><b>Accord:</b> the importance of respecting your comrades and getting along.</p>		
			<br/>
			<p class="nonothead"><b>On-duty specifications</b></p>
			<p class="nonot"><b>1:</b> When present on duty, you are expected to follow ALL the rules and regulations at ALL times. There are no exceptions.</p>
			<p class="nonot"><b>2:</b> Nobody is above the law. If you see somebody breaking one of the Foundation’s laws, rules, or Code of Ethics, you are to enact the Record, Report, Remind system.</p>			
			<br/>
			<p class="nonothead"><b>The Written Laws of Ignis Faatus</b></p>
			<p class="nonot"><b>1:</b> You may only speak when necessary (view law 4). You may NOT engage in any conversation that doesn't correlate with your duties.</p>
			<p class="nonot"><b>2:</b> All Foundation personnels should be addressed as "Personnel". If you <b>know</b> that they are an executive ( Level - 4 and above), you should address them as "Executive". O5 Councilors should be addressed as "Councilor". The Administrator should be addressed as "Administrator" in person and "The Administrator" when speaking about him. You must not in any circumstances mention names. You address them by their rank. If you are doubtful of their rank whether they are an executive, you should address them as "personnel".</p>
			<p class="nonot"><b>3:</b> An Ignis must <b>ALWAYS</b> be professional, this cannot be stressed enough. Though there are many ways to define maturity, we look at immaturity as whether an Ignis is behaving in an appropriate manner depending on the situation. This means messing around in places like a raid or defense will not be tolerated, and a strict, serious attitude is required at all times.</p>
			<p class="nonot"><b>4:</b> You will be the one to decide whether you may speak or not depending on the situation. However; when speaking publicly, Ignis are expected to present themselves well in all aspects, including that of speaking. Full grammar and punctuation is expected to be used when on duty. Full stops, capital letters, commas, etc, fall into this category. You are also required to spell to the best of your ability, so that there are less miss-communications. If you are on-site, you must use the dialog chat.</p>
