			<p class="nonothead"><b>Overview</b></p>
			<p class="nonot">If you are reading this; chances are, you are newly accepted into Ignis Fatuus. Congratulations. This page is the hub for almost all information that is needed in Ignis Fatuus.</p>
			<br/>
			<p class="nonothead"><b>Duties</b></p>
			<p class="nonot">To summarize it; Ignis Fatuus plays a major role as the vanguard of the Foundation. You are the game-changer. At the same time, Ignis Fatuus acts as a police force within the Foundation for <b>non-trivial</b> matters.</p>
			<br/>
			<p class="nonothead"><b>Record, Report, Remind</b></p>
			<p class="nonot">As an Ignis Fatuus. It is your duty to maintain law and order within the Foundation. The Record, Report, Remind (RRR) begins when one sees another personnel breaking the rule and/or the Code of Ethics <b>that are not trivial.</b> It is your duty to follow through with this system if you see anything happening. The RRR system is broken down as:</p>
			<p class="nonot">Record: If a person in question has broken any rule, you must take it upon yourself to begin collecting evidences. Evidence is not exclusively limited to video, the four options for recording incidents are: video recordings, screenshots, audio, or three witnesses.</p>
			<p class="nonot">Report: After the evidence is collected, the next stage is to report the lawbreaker with evidence to the appropriate person who can handle the situation within Ignis. This is dependent on the lawbreakers rank within the Foundation. Further actions will depend on the matter.</p>
			<p class="nonot">Remind: After the report has been made, this is where things start. Ignis Fatuus will approach the person in question and "remind" them about the matter. The person in question will be punished/interrogated depending on the matter. Further actions will be improvised.</p>
			<br/>
			<p class="nonothead"><b>Composure, Obedience, Accord</b></p>
